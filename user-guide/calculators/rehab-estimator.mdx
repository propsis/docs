## When to use this tool

Use the Rehab Estimator when you need a detailed renovation budget for a flip or BRRRR deal. Instead of guessing a single rehab number, break costs down by room and category for a more accurate estimate.

## How it works

The Rehab Estimator organizes renovation costs by area of the property:

### Interior categories
| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Kitchen** | Cabinets, countertops, appliances, flooring, backsplash, plumbing |
| **Bathrooms** | Vanity, toilet, tub/shower, tile, plumbing fixtures |
| **Bedrooms** | Flooring, paint, closet doors, lighting |
| **Living areas** | Flooring, paint, baseboards, lighting |
| **Basement** | Waterproofing, framing, insulation, flooring |

### Systems
| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Electrical** | Panel upgrade, rewiring, fixtures, outlets |
| **Plumbing** | Pipe replacement, water heater, fixtures |
| **HVAC** | Furnace, AC, ductwork, thermostat |
| **Roofing** | Shingles, flashing, gutters |

### Exterior
| Category | Examples |
|----------|---------|
| **Siding** | Vinyl, fiber cement, repair, painting |
| **Landscaping** | Grading, sod, trees, fencing |
| **Driveway/Walkway** | Concrete, asphalt, pavers |
| **Windows/Doors** | Replacement windows, entry doors, garage door |

## Entering estimates

For each category:

1. **Select the scope** — Full replacement, partial repair, or cosmetic update
2. **Enter quantity** — Square footage, unit count, or lump sum
3. **Enter cost** — Per unit cost or total cost for the category
4. **Add notes** — Specific details (e.g., "granite countertops, 40 sqft")

## Contingency

The estimator automatically adds a configurable contingency percentage (default: 10–15%) to account for unexpected costs. Adjust this based on your experience and the property's condition.

## Using estimates in calculators

Once your rehab estimate is complete, the total feeds directly into your Fix & Flip or BRRRR calculator as the rehab cost input. No need to manually transfer numbers.

<Tip>
  Build rehab estimate templates for common renovation levels (cosmetic, moderate, full gut). Reuse them across deals and adjust as needed.
