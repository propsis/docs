## When to use this calculator

Use the Rental Analysis calculator when evaluating a property as a long-term rental (buy and hold). It helps you determine whether the property generates enough income to justify the investment.

## Outputs

| Metric | What It Means | Good Target |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| **Net Operating Income (NOI)** | Gross income minus operating expenses (before debt service) | — |
| **Monthly Cash Flow** | NOI minus monthly mortgage payment | > $200/mo per unit |
| **Cap Rate** | NOI ÷ property value, as a percentage | 5–10% depending on market |
| **Cash-on-Cash Return** | Annual cash flow ÷ total cash invested | > 8% |
| **DSCR** | NOI ÷ annual debt payments | > 1.25 |
| **Gross Rent Multiplier** | Purchase price ÷ annual gross rent | Lower is better |
| **Total Cash Required** | Down payment + closing + rehab | — |

## Understanding the key metrics

### Cap rate
The capitalization rate measures the property's return independent of financing. Higher cap rates indicate higher returns but often come with more risk or less desirable locations.

### Cash-on-cash return
This is your actual return on the cash you put in. It accounts for financing, so a leveraged deal can have a higher cash-on-cash return than cap rate.

### DSCR (Debt Service Coverage Ratio)
Lenders use this to determine if the property's income can cover the mortgage. A DSCR of 1.25 means the property generates 25% more income than needed to cover debt payments. Most lenders require a minimum of 1.2–1.25.

## Tips for accurate analysis

- **Use actual market rents** — Check comparable rentals in the area, not listing prices or landlord asking rents.
- **Don't skip vacancy** — Even in hot rental markets, budget 5–8% for vacancy and turnover costs.
- **Budget for CapEx** — Roofs, HVAC, and water heaters don't last forever. 5–10% of rent for reserves is prudent.
- **Include management costs** — Even if you self-manage, include 8–10% so the numbers work if you ever hire a manager.
