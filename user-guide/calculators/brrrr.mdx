## When to use this calculator

Use the BRRRR calculator when you're evaluating a property for the Buy, Rehab, Rent, Refinance, Repeat strategy. This calculator goes beyond a simple flip analysis to model the refinance step and ongoing rental income.

## The BRRRR strategy

1. **Buy** — Purchase a below-market property
2. **Rehab** — Renovate to increase value
3. **Rent** — Place a tenant and stabilize income
4. **Refinance** — Cash-out refinance based on the new (higher) appraised value
5. **Repeat** — Use the refinance proceeds to fund the next deal

## Inputs

### Acquisition
| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Purchase Price** | Property acquisition cost | $120,000 |
| **Rehab Costs** | Total renovation budget | $40,000 |
| **After Repair Value (ARV)** | Appraised value after renovation | $210,000 |
| **Closing Costs (Buy)** | Purchase closing costs | $3,600 |

### Rental Income
| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Monthly Rent** | Gross monthly rental income | $1,800 |
| **Vacancy Rate** | Expected vacancy as percentage | 8% |
| **Monthly Expenses** | Taxes, insurance, maintenance, management | $650/mo |

### Refinance
| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Refinance LTV** | Loan-to-value ratio on refinance | 75% |
| **Interest Rate** | Refinance loan interest rate | 7.5% |
| **Loan Term** | Refinance loan term | 30 years |
| **Closing Costs (Refi)** | Refinance closing costs | $3,000 |

## Outputs

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **All-In Cost** | Purchase + rehab + closing costs — your total investment before refinance |
| **Refinance Amount** | ARV × LTV — the loan proceeds you receive |
| **Cash Left in Deal** | All-in cost minus refinance proceeds — money still tied up |
| **Equity Captured** | ARV minus refinance loan — your equity position |
| **Monthly Cash Flow** | Rent minus expenses minus mortgage payment |
| **Cash-on-Cash Return** | Annual cash flow divided by cash left in deal |
| **ROI** | Return based on cash remaining in the deal |

## The ideal BRRRR outcome

The best BRRRR deals let you pull out **all or most of your initial investment** at refinance, leaving little to no cash in the deal while generating positive monthly cash flow. This lets you "recycle" your capital into the next deal.

- **Cash left in deal = $0** means you got all your money back
- **Positive cash flow** means the property pays for itself
- **High equity** means you're building wealth

## Tips for accurate analysis

- **Be conservative on ARV.** The refinance appraisal is the critical moment — if it comes in low, you leave more cash in the deal.
- **Budget for seasoning periods.** Many lenders require 6–12 months of ownership before refinancing.
- **Use realistic rent estimates.** Check local market rents rather than optimistic projections.
- **Account for vacancy.** 5–10% vacancy rate is standard for most markets.
