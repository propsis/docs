## Financial calculators

Propsis includes four built-in financial calculators tailored to real estate investing strategies. Each calculator is designed to replace the spreadsheets investors typically use — faster, more accurate, and directly attached to each deal.

## How calculators work

1. **Open a deal** and navigate to the Financials tab
2. **Choose a calculator** that matches your investment strategy
3. **Enter your inputs** — purchase price, rehab costs, rental income, financing terms, etc.
4. **Results update in real-time** as you adjust inputs
5. **Save your analysis** to keep it attached to the deal

## Saving and comparing

- Each deal can have **multiple saved analyses** (e.g., conservative and aggressive scenarios)
- Saved analyses include a name, date, and all inputs/outputs
- Compare results side by side from the Financials tab
- Historical analyses are preserved even if you update inputs later

## Key metrics across calculators

| Metric | Used In | What It Tells You |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **ARV** | Flip, BRRRR | What the property is worth after rehab |
| **MAO** | Flip | Maximum you should pay |
| **ROI** | Flip, BRRRR | Total return on investment |
| **Cap Rate** | Rental | Annual return on property value |
| **Cash-on-Cash** | Rental, BRRRR | Annual return on cash invested |
| **Monthly Cash Flow** | Rental, BRRRR | Net income after all expenses |
| **DSCR** | Rental | Whether income covers debt payments |
| **Equity Captured** | BRRRR | How much equity you gain at refinance |

<Tip>
  Calculators are available from the deal detail view. Run them as early as the Analysis stage to decide whether a deal is worth pursuing.
