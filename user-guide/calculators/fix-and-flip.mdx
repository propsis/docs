## When to use this calculator

Use the Fix & Flip calculator when you're evaluating a property to buy, renovate, and sell for profit. It tells you whether the deal hits your target returns and what the maximum you should pay is.

## Inputs

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Purchase Price** | What you'll pay for the property | $175,000 |
| **After Repair Value (ARV)** | Estimated sale price after renovation | $275,000 |
| **Rehab Costs** | Total renovation budget | $45,000 |
| **Holding Costs** | Monthly carrying costs (taxes, insurance, utilities, loan interest) | $2,500/mo |
| **Holding Period** | Estimated months from purchase to sale | 5 months |
| **Closing Costs (Buy)** | Closing costs on purchase | 2% of purchase |
| **Closing Costs (Sell)** | Closing costs on sale (agent commissions, title, etc.) | 8% of ARV |
| **Financing** | Loan amount, interest rate, points | 80% LTV, 12%, 2 pts |

## Outputs

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Projected Profit** | ARV minus all costs (purchase + rehab + holding + closing + financing) |
| **Return on Investment (ROI)** | Profit divided by total cash invested, as a percentage |
| **Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO)** | The most you should pay to hit your target profit margin (typically ARV × 70% − rehab costs) |
| **Total Investment** | Sum of all cash out of pocket |
| **Cash Required** | Down payment + rehab + closing costs + reserves |

## The 70% rule

A common investor guideline: **MAO = ARV × 70% − Rehab Costs**. This builds in a profit margin while accounting for costs and unexpected expenses.

The Propsis calculator lets you adjust this percentage to match your personal targets and market conditions.

## Tips for accurate analysis

- **ARV is the most important input.** Use the CMA tool to get a data-backed estimate rather than guessing.
- **Pad rehab costs by 10–15%.** Unexpected expenses are the norm, not the exception.
- **Don't forget holding costs.** Every extra month eats into your profit.
- **Factor in financing costs.** Hard money interest and points add up fast.
