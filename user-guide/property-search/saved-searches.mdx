## Saving searches

If you frequently search for properties in specific areas or with specific criteria, save your search parameters for quick access later.

## What you can save

- **Location criteria** — ZIP code, city, county
- **Property characteristics** — Property type, bedroom/bathroom count, sqft range
- **Price range** — Min/max property value
- **Other filters** — Year built range, lot size, etc.

## Managing saved searches

- **Name your search** — Give it a descriptive label (e.g., "Tampa 3BR SFH Under $250K")
- **Re-run anytime** — One click to execute the saved search with current data
- **Edit criteria** — Update search parameters as your strategy evolves
- **Delete** — Remove searches you no longer need

## Use cases

- **Market monitoring** — Save searches for your target neighborhoods and check periodically for new properties
- **Deal sourcing** — Quickly scan for properties matching your investment criteria
- **Area research** — Track property data trends in specific ZIP codes over time
