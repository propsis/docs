## Using property data in your workflow

When you find a property you want to pursue:

1. **Add it as a deal** — Click "Add to Pipeline" to create a deal with the property data pre-filled
2. **Run comps** — Jump to the CMA tool to find comparable sales
3. **Start your analysis** — Property details auto-populate into your financial calculators

This eliminates the manual data entry that typically takes 5–10 minutes per property.

<Tip>
  Property data auto-fills when you add a deal by address. No need to manually search and then re-enter the information.
