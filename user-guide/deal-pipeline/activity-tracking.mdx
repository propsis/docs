## Activity timeline

Every deal has an activity timeline that automatically logs all actions. This gives you a complete history of what happened, when, and who did it.

## What gets tracked

| Activity Type | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Stage change** | Deal moved from one pipeline stage to another |
| **Note added** | A new note was created on the deal |
| **Document uploaded** | A file was attached to the deal |
| **Analysis saved** | A calculator result was saved |
| **Deal created** | The deal was first created |
| **Assignee changed** | The deal was assigned or reassigned |
| **Temperature changed** | Deal priority was updated |
| **Deadline added/changed** | A deadline was created or modified |

## Viewing activity

**On the deal detail view:** The Activity tab shows a chronological timeline with the most recent 50 events. Use pagination to load older activity.

**On the dashboard:** The Recent Activity feed shows the latest actions across all your deals — a global view of what's happening in your pipeline.

## Activity entry format

Each activity entry shows:

- **Icon** representing the activity type
- **Description** of what changed (e.g., "Moved from Research to Analysis")
- **User** who performed the action
- **Timestamp** — relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago") or absolute date

## Using activity for deal management

The activity timeline helps you:

- **Spot stale deals** — No activity for 14+ days triggers a Stale warning
- **Track team actions** — See who did what on shared deals
- **Audit trail** — Full history for due diligence and compliance
- **Follow up** — Know exactly where you left off on any deal
