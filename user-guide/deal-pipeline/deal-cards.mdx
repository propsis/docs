## Anatomy of a deal card

Each deal in the pipeline is represented by a card showing the most important information at a glance:

- **Property address** — Street address as the primary label (bold)
- **City, State ZIP** — Location below the address
- **List price** — Formatted as currency (e.g., $275,000)
- **Deal type badge** — Flip, BRRRR, or Rental
- **Temperature indicator** — Visual priority badge (Hot, Warm, Neutral, Cold)
- **Days in stage** — How long the deal has been in its current stage
- **Assignee avatar** — Team member assigned to this deal (if applicable)

## Temperature indicators

Temperature badges help you quickly identify deal priority:

| Badge | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| Hot | Red | High priority — act fast |
| Warm | Orange | Active, moderate priority |
| Neutral | Gray | Default state, no urgency flag |
| Cold | Blue | Low priority, back burner |
| Stale | Gray with warning icon | No activity for 14+ days (auto-detected) |

You can set the temperature manually from the deal card action menu or from the deal detail view.

The **Stale** badge is automatically applied by the system when no activity has been recorded for a configurable period (default: 14 days). This helps surface deals that might be slipping through the cracks.

## Deadline warnings

If a deal has upcoming or overdue deadlines, the card displays:

- **Red badge** — Overdue items that need immediate attention
- **Yellow badge** — Items due within the next 3 days

## Card interactions

- **Click** a card to open the full deal detail view
- **Drag** a card to move it between pipeline stages
- **Right-click** (or use the `...` menu) for quick actions: move stage, change temperature, archive, or delete

## Sorting deals within a column

Within each pipeline column, deals can be sorted by:

| Sort option | Direction |
|-------------|-----------|
| Date Added | Ascending / Descending |
| Last Updated | Ascending / Descending |
| ARV | Ascending / Descending |
| Potential Profit | Ascending / Descending |
| Days in Stage | Ascending / Descending |

Sort preferences persist per column. You can also manually drag-sort cards for custom ordering.
