## Search

The search bar at the top of the pipeline view lets you find deals instantly.

**How it works:**
- Type to search in real time (results appear after a 300ms debounce)
- Searches across: address, city, state, ZIP, seller name, and notes
- Matching text is highlighted in the results

## Filters

Use filters to narrow your pipeline view to specific criteria. Multiple filters can be combined using AND logic.

| Filter | Options |
|--------|---------|
| **Price Range** | Min / max currency value |
| **Property Type** | Single Family, Multi-Family, Condo, Townhouse, etc. |
| **Deal Type** | Fix & Flip, BRRRR, Rental |
| **Bedrooms** | Minimum bed count |
| **Bathrooms** | Minimum bath count |
| **Square Footage** | Min / max sqft |
| **Date Added** | Date range |
| **Last Activity** | Date range |
| **Calculator Results** | Minimum ROI, minimum cash flow |

### Active filter chips

When filters are active, they appear as removable chips below the search bar. Click the **X** on any chip to remove that filter.

### Saved filter presets

Save commonly used filter combinations as presets for one-click access. For example:

- "High-ROI Flips" — Deal Type: Flip, ROI > 25%
- "Stale Deals" — Last Activity: more than 14 days ago
- "Local SFH" — Property Type: SFH, ZIP: your target area

## Sort options

Within each pipeline column, deals can be sorted by:

| Sort By | Direction |
|---------|-----------|
| Date Added | Ascending / Descending |
| Last Updated | Ascending / Descending |
| ARV | Ascending / Descending |
| Potential Profit | Ascending / Descending |
| Days in Stage | Ascending / Descending |

Sort preferences are saved per column and persist across sessions.
