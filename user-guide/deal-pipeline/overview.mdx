## The deal pipeline

The deal pipeline is the heart of Propsis. It's a visual kanban board that shows every deal you're working on, organized by stage. At a glance, you can see how many deals are in each stage, what needs attention, and where to focus your time.

## Pipeline layout

The pipeline displays as a horizontal kanban board with one column per stage:

- **8 columns** from left to right: Lead → Research → Analysis → Due Diligence → Offer → Under Contract → Closed → Dead
- **Column headers** show the stage name and deal count
- **Deal cards** within each column display key property info
- **Horizontal scrolling** when all columns don't fit on screen

## Working with deals

### Adding a deal

Click **+ Add Deal** from the pipeline header or dashboard. Enter the property address, list price, and deal type. The deal is created in the **Lead** stage.

### Moving deals between stages

There are two ways to move a deal:

1. **Drag and drop** — Grab a deal card and drop it into a different stage column
2. **Stage selector** — Open the deal detail and use the stage dropdown

Every stage change is logged in the deal's activity timeline with a timestamp and the user who made the change.

### Deal card information

Each card in the pipeline shows:

- Property address (street, city, state, ZIP)
- List price (formatted as currency)
- Deal type badge (Flip, BRRRR, Rental)
- Temperature indicator (Hot, Warm, Neutral, Cold, Stale)
- Days in current stage
- Assignee avatar (if the deal is assigned to a team member)

### Quick actions

Right-click a deal card or use the action menu to:

- Move to a specific stage
- Change temperature / priority
- Archive the deal
- Delete the deal

## Pipeline statistics

The pipeline header displays aggregate metrics:

- **Total active deals** across all stages
- **Pipeline value** (sum of all deal values)
- **Stage distribution** — visual bar showing how deals are spread across stages
- **Average days in pipeline** — how long deals typically take from Lead to Closed
- **Win rate** — percentage of deals that reach Closed vs Dead

## Performance

The pipeline is designed to handle large deal volumes:

- Loads under 1 second for 100 deals
- Skeleton loading states while data loads
- Optimistic updates — moves feel instant, synced in the background
