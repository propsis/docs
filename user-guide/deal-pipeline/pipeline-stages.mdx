## Stage overview

Propsis uses 8 fixed, sequential stages. They reflect the natural lifecycle of a real estate deal and enforce a consistent process so you never skip critical steps.

<Note>
  Pipeline stages are preset and cannot be modified, reordered, or deleted. This is by design — a structured process prevents costly mistakes.

## Stage details

### Lead

The starting point. You've identified a property that might be worth pursuing — maybe from a driving-for-dollars session, a wholesaler, MLS listing, or a referral.

**What to do here:** Capture the basic property info (address, asking price, property type) and any initial notes about why this deal caught your eye.

**Move to Research when:** You've decided this deal is worth a closer look.

### Research

Time to gather information. Check comps, research the neighborhood, look up ownership history, and assess the general viability of the deal.

**What to do here:** Use the Property Search tool to pull data, run a quick CMA for comparable sales, and evaluate the area.

**Move to Analysis when:** You have enough data to run the financial numbers.

### Analysis

Run the numbers. This is where the financial calculators come in — determine whether this deal makes sense for your strategy and target returns.

**What to do here:** Use the Fix & Flip, BRRRR, or Rental calculator. Calculate ARV, MAO, projected profit, cap rate, or cash flow depending on your strategy.

**Move to Due Diligence when:** The numbers work and you want to proceed.

### Due Diligence

Dig deeper before committing. This stage covers inspections, title search, contractor bids, and any other verification needed before making an offer.

**What to do here:** Schedule inspections, get rehab bids, verify title, check for liens, and upload all findings as documents on the deal.

**Move to Offer when:** Due diligence checks out and you're ready to make an offer.

### Offer

Your offer is submitted and you're waiting for a response.

**What to do here:** Track the offer amount, terms, and deadlines. Set deadline reminders so nothing slips.

**Move to Under Contract when:** Your offer is accepted.

### Under Contract

The offer is accepted and you're in the contract period. This is the final stretch before closing.

**What to do here:** Coordinate with your lender, title company, and any other parties. Track closing deadlines, upload contracts, and manage final tasks.

**Move to Closed when:** You close on the property. Move to Dead if the deal falls through.

### Closed

Deal complete. The property has been acquired (or sold, if flipping). This is a terminal stage.

**What to do here:** Record final numbers, attach closing documents, and celebrate. Closed deals contribute to your win rate and portfolio metrics.

### Dead

The deal didn't work out — you walked away, the seller rejected your offer, or something in due diligence killed it.

**What to do here:** Add a note explaining why the deal died. This history is valuable for recognizing patterns over time.

<Tip>
  Deals in Closed and Dead stages can be reopened if circumstances change. Just drag them back to an active stage.
