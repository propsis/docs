## No more scattered files

Every real estate deal generates documents — contracts, inspection reports, photos, appraisals, title work, insurance quotes. Before Propsis, these lived in email inboxes, Google Drive folders, camera rolls, and desktop folders with no connection to the deal.

Propsis attaches all documents directly to the deal they belong to.
