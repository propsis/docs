## Uploading documents

### Drag and drop

Drag files from your computer directly into the Documents tab of any deal. Multiple files can be uploaded at once.

### File picker

Click the **Upload** button to open your system file picker. Select one or more files to upload.

### From the deal detail view

Navigate to any deal → Documents tab → Upload. Documents are immediately attached to that deal.

## Organizing files

### Categories

When uploading, assign a category to help organize:

- Contracts
- Inspections
- Photos
- Appraisals
- Title
- Financial
- Other

If no category is selected, documents are placed in "Other" by default.

### Naming

Files retain their original filenames. You can rename files after upload for clarity.

## Viewing documents

- **PDF files** — Preview inline directly in the browser
- **Images** — Display in a photo viewer with zoom
- **Other files** — Download to view locally

## Photo management

Property photos have special handling:

- Display in a carousel on the deal Overview tab
- Up to **20 photos** load with the deal detail view
- Photos can be reordered by drag-and-drop
- Support for before/after comparison (tag photos with renovation stage)

## Storage

Each deal has a generous storage allocation for documents. File uploads are stored securely using Supabase Storage with row-level security ensuring only authorized users can access deal documents.
