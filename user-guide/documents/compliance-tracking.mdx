## Why compliance tracking matters

Missing a document during a real estate transaction can delay closing, kill a deal, or create legal exposure. Propsis helps you track which documents are required at each stage and flags what's missing.

## How it works

Each pipeline stage has a set of recommended documents. As you move a deal through stages, Propsis shows which documents are present and which are still needed.

## Documents by stage

| Stage | Recommended Documents |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Research** | Property photos, initial notes |
| **Analysis** | Calculator results, CMA report |
| **Due Diligence** | Inspection report, title search, contractor bids |
| **Offer** | Purchase agreement, proof of funds, pre-approval letter |
| **Under Contract** | Signed contract, earnest money receipt, insurance quote |
| **Closed** | HUD statement, deed, title insurance, final walkthrough photos |

## Compliance indicators

On the deal detail view, each stage's document requirements show:

- **Green check** — Document uploaded and categorized
- **Yellow warning** — Document recommended but not yet uploaded
- **Red alert** — Document required and missing (deal has been in this stage for an extended period)

## Customization

While the recommended document lists come with sensible defaults, the specific documents needed can vary by deal type, state, and investment strategy. Use the compliance view as a guide rather than a rigid requirement.

<Tip>
  Upload documents as you receive them — don't wait until closing. Staying ahead of document requirements prevents last-minute scrambles.
