## What is Propsis?

Propsis is a deal pipeline and financial analysis platform purpose-built for real estate investors. It brings deal tracking, financial calculators, comparable market analysis, property search, and document management into one integrated workspace.

Whether you're running fix-and-flip, BRRRR, or buy-and-hold strategies, Propsis gives you the speed and organization to analyze deals in minutes instead of hours — so you can make competitive offers before other investors.

## Who is Propsis for?

Propsis is designed for active real estate investors who:

- Analyze **50–500+ deals per year**
- Close **1–15 deals per year**
- Manage **5–50 active deals** in their pipeline at any time
- Use strategies like **Fix & Flip**, **BRRRR**, or **Buy & Hold**
- Range from solo operators to small teams of 2–4 people

## The problem we solve

Real estate investors today juggle disconnected spreadsheets, notes apps, and file storage tools. The result is spreadsheet chaos, slow analysis (15–20 minutes per deal), deals falling through the cracks, and scattered documents across email, Google Drive, and camera rolls.

Propsis replaces this fragmented workflow with a single source of truth.

## Pipeline stages

Every deal flows through a structured pipeline with 8 preset stages:

| Stage | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **Lead** | Initial property identified, not yet researched |
| **Research** | Gathering information, checking comps |
| **Analysis** | Running financial calculations |
| **Due Diligence** | Inspections, title search, deeper evaluation |
| **Offer** | Offer submitted, awaiting response |
| **Under Contract** | Offer accepted, in contract period |
| **Closed** | Deal completed successfully |
| **Dead** | Deal killed or lost |

Stages are fixed to enforce a consistent process — no more skipping steps that lead to costly mistakes.
