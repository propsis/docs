## Step 1: Create your account

Sign up at [app.propsis.io/signup](https://app.propsis.io/signup) with your email and password.

- Passwords must be at least 8 characters with at least 1 number and 1 special character
- You'll receive a verification email — click the link to activate your account
- Once verified, you'll land on your dashboard

## Step 2: Explore the dashboard

Your dashboard shows a high-level view of your deal pipeline, including active deals, pipeline value, market pulse data, and recent activity. From here you can:

- View pipeline statistics and stage distribution
- See action items that need your attention
- Track market trends for your deal areas
- Jump into any feature from the sidebar navigation

## Step 3: Add your first deal

Click the **+ Add Deal** button from the pipeline or dashboard to create a new deal.

At minimum, enter:
- **Property address** (street, city, state, ZIP)
- **List price** or asking price
- **Deal type** — Fix & Flip, BRRRR, or Rental

Your deal starts in the **Lead** stage. As you research and analyze, drag it through the pipeline stages.

## Step 4: Run a financial analysis

Open a deal and navigate to the **Financials** tab. Choose the calculator that matches your strategy:

- **Fix & Flip** — Enter purchase price, rehab costs, and ARV to get projected profit, ROI, and Maximum Allowable Offer (MAO)
- **BRRRR** — Add rental income and refinance terms to analyze the full Buy-Rehab-Rent-Refinance-Repeat cycle
- **Rental Analysis** — Input rental income and expenses to calculate cap rate, cash-on-cash return, and monthly cash flow

Results update in real-time as you adjust inputs. Save your analysis to keep it attached to the deal.

## Step 5: Move deals through the pipeline

As your deal progresses, drag it between stages on the kanban board or use the stage selector in the deal detail view:

1. **Lead** → You found the property
2. **Research** → Run comps, check the neighborhood
3. **Analysis** → Run your financial calculator
4. **Due Diligence** → Schedule inspections, title search
5. **Offer** → Submit your offer
6. **Under Contract** → Offer accepted, working toward close
7. **Closed** → Congratulations!

Each stage change is automatically logged in the deal's activity timeline.
