| **High** | > 6 months | Buyer's market — prices may be softening, more negotiating power |

## Using market data in your analysis

Market trends help you:

- **Validate ARV estimates** — Is the market appreciating or declining? Adjust expectations accordingly.
- **Time your exits** — In a rising market, holding a flip slightly longer might increase profit. In a declining market, sell fast.
- **Identify opportunity areas** — Low-inventory markets often mean strong appreciation potential but more competition for deals.
- **Support lender presentations** — Showing market data alongside your analysis builds credibility with lenders and partners.
