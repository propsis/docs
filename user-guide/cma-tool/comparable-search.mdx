## Finding comparables

The comparable search finds recently sold properties that are similar to your subject property. Good comps are essential for an accurate ARV estimate.

## Search criteria

When searching for comps, you can filter by:

| Criteria | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Location** | Radius from subject property | 0.5–1 mile |
| **Sale Date** | How recently the property sold | Last 6 months |
| **Property Type** | Match the subject property type | Same type |
| **Square Footage** | Range around subject property sqft | ±20% |
| **Bedrooms** | Bedroom count range | ±1 bedroom |
| **Bathrooms** | Bathroom count range | ±1 bathroom |
| **Year Built** | Age range | ±10 years |
| **Lot Size** | Lot size range | ±25% |

## Reviewing results

Search results display as a list of comparable properties, each showing:

- Property address and distance from subject
- Sale price and sale date
- Bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage
- Year built and lot size
- Price per square foot
- Key differences from subject property

## Selecting comps

Choose **3–6 comparables** that most closely match your subject property. Best practices for comp selection:

- **Closer is better** — Comps within 0.5 miles are more relevant than those 1+ miles away
- **Recent sales matter** — Sales within the last 3 months carry more weight than 6-month-old sales
- **Similar condition** — Try to find comps in similar condition to your subject's expected post-rehab state
- **Same neighborhood** — Don't cross major boundaries (highways, school districts) if possible

## Adjustments

After selecting comps, adjustments are applied for differences between each comp and your subject property. Adjustments may include:

- **Square footage** — Price per sqft × difference
- **Bedrooms/bathrooms** — Fixed dollar adjustment per unit
- **Condition** — Subjective adjustment for renovation quality
- **Lot size** — Adjustment for significant lot size differences
- **Garage** — Adjustment for garage presence or size
- **Age** — Adjustment for significant age differences

The AI applies these adjustments automatically based on local market data, but you can override any adjustment manually.
