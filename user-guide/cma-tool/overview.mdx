## What is the CMA tool?

The Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) tool uses AI to estimate a property's value by analyzing recently sold comparable properties. Instead of manually searching Zillow or building spreadsheets, Propsis automates the process of finding comps, applying adjustments, and generating an ARV estimate.

## How it works

1. **Enter your subject property** — The property you're analyzing
2. **Search for comps** — Propsis finds recently sold properties matching your criteria
3. **Review and select comps** — Choose the most relevant 3–6 comparables
4. **AI applies adjustments** — Differences in sqft, bedrooms, condition, etc. are adjusted
5. **Get your ARV estimate** — A data-backed after-repair value for your analysis

## Using CMA results in your workflow

CMA results feed directly into your financial calculators:

- The **ARV estimate** becomes the ARV input in your Fix & Flip or BRRRR calculator
- **Market trend data** helps you assess whether the market is appreciating or declining
- **Comp details** support your analysis when presenting to lenders or partners

<Tip>
  Run a CMA during the Research stage of your pipeline to determine if a deal is worth moving to Analysis.
