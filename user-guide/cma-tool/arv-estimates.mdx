## What is an ARV estimate?

The After Repair Value (ARV) is the estimated market value of a property after renovations are complete. It's the most critical number in a flip or BRRRR analysis — it determines your projected profit, MAO, and refinance amount.

## How Propsis calculates ARV

1. **Gather comps** — Recently sold properties that match your subject
2. **Apply adjustments** — Account for differences in size, bedrooms, condition, etc.
3. **Calculate adjusted values** — Each comp's sale price is adjusted up or down
4. **Generate estimate** — Weighted average of adjusted comp values

## ARV output

The ARV estimate includes:

- **Estimated ARV** — The recommended after-repair value
- **Confidence range** — Low and high estimates showing the range of possible values
- **Per-comp breakdown** — Each comp's original price, adjustments, and adjusted value
- **Adjustment details** — What was adjusted and by how much

## Interpreting the confidence range

| Range Width | What It Means |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Narrow** (< 5%) | High confidence — comps are very similar and consistent |
| **Moderate** (5–10%) | Reasonable confidence — some variation in comps |
| **Wide** (> 10%) | Lower confidence — comps vary significantly, proceed with caution |

When the range is wide, consider finding additional comps or adjusting your search criteria to find more comparable properties.

## Using ARV in your analysis

Once you have an ARV estimate:

- **Fix & Flip** — ARV feeds into the MAO calculation (typically ARV × 70% − rehab costs) and projected profit
- **BRRRR** — ARV determines your refinance amount (ARV × LTV) and how much cash you recover
- **Rental** — ARV helps determine current market value for cap rate calculation

## Manual override

If you have local knowledge or additional data points (recent appraisals, agent opinions, etc.), you can manually adjust the ARV estimate. The original AI estimate is preserved for reference.

<Warning>
  ARV is an estimate, not a guarantee. Market conditions can change between your analysis and the actual sale or appraisal. Always build margin into your numbers.
