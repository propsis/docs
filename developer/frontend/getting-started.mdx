## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm
- Git
- Access to the Propsis GitHub repository

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/launchtheoryai/propsis.git
cd propsis
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Session start checklist

Before writing any code, read these files in order:

1. `CLAUDE.md` — Project rules and development guidelines
2. `docs/propsis-mvp-prd.md` — Product requirements
3. `docs/propsis-user-stories.md` — User stories and acceptance criteria
4. `app/globals.css` — Design system CSS variables

Then check your branch state:

```bash
git branch          # What branch am I on?
git status          # Current state?
git checkout main && git pull origin main   # Sync if needed
```

## Branch naming

```bash
# Frontend feature branches
users/este/feature/ui-[feature-name]

# Examples
users/este/feature/ui-deal-detail-dialog
users/este/feature/ui-calculator-inputs
users/este/feature/ui-pipeline-search
```

## Development workflow

1. Start from `main` — Always pull latest before branching
2. Create a feature branch following the naming convention
3. Read relevant user stories and acceptance criteria
4. Write a plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
5. Wait for approval before starting implementation
6. Complete tasks one at a time, marking done as you go
7. Run all checks before committing

## Pre-commit checklist (mandatory)

Run all four checks before every commit — no exceptions:

```bash
npm run lint          # Must pass — no warnings
npm run format        # Auto-format code
npm run type-check    # Must pass — no TypeScript errors
npm run build         # Must build successfully
```

If any check fails, fix it before committing.

## Commit messages

Use conventional commits with `(ui)` scope:

```bash
feat(ui): Add Deal Detail Dialog with property info
fix(ui): Fix null check in deal header component
refactor(ui): Extract metric card to reusable component
style(ui): Update calculator input styling
chore(ui): Clean up unused imports
```

## PR creation

**Title format:**
```
feat(ui): [Feature Name] (US-XX-XXX)
```

Include in every PR description: summary, user story reference, components created/modified, testing instructions, screenshots, and the quality checklist.

## Code rules

- **No `any` types** — Use proper TypeScript everywhere
- **Proper null checks** — Use optional chaining (`?.`) and nullish coalescing (`??`)
- **`useCallback`** for functions passed to children
- **`useMemo`** for expensive computations
- **Proper dependency arrays** in `useEffect`
- **Keys on list items** — Always provide unique keys
- **No hardcoded colors** — CSS variables only
- **No dynamic Tailwind** — Static class mapping only
- **Server components by default** — `"use client"` only when needed
